## 1. Introduction

Data must first be integrated into an IT system before it can be used and its value observed. This 
implies that all data from multiple sources must be standardized and unified in order for other 
programs to utilize them. Implementing a data warehouse is one approach to accomplish this. 
In this project, we are going to design and implement a Data Warehouse with calls data analysis of a 
call center. For this, we will use SQL Server and SSIS. 

__DATA - Description for Call Center Analysis Project__

In our project we proceed with an analysis of call center operations, employee performance, call types, 
and call charges. To facilitate this analysis, we have organized a structured dataset that encompasses 
CSV files and lookup data, each with its specific role and relevance in uncovering insights and 
optimizing call center activities.
